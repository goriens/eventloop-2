We know that the brain combines sensory input from all over your body into a single perception, but not how. We think brains compute in some sense, but we can't say what those computations are. We believe that the brain is organized as a hierarchy, with different pieces all working collaboratively to make a single model of the world. But we can explain neither how those pieces are differentiated, nor how they collaborate.",
